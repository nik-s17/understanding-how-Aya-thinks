## Project Context

This research is part of the **Cohere Expedition: Aya Program**, an initiative to explore and better understand the capabilities, behaviors, and multilingual reasoning of the Aya model.  
We investigate how Aya internally processes information across languages and whether English-centric reasoning is prevalent.

## Model Clarification

All experiments in this project use the **[Aya Expanse](https://docs.cohere.com/docs/aya-expanse)** (`c4ai-aya-expanse-8b`) model developed by Cohere.

Aya Expanse is described as a **highly performant multilingual model** capable of working with **23 languages**, providing strong capabilities in generation, reasoning, and understanding across diverse linguistic inputs.

---

## Summary Conclusions

### 1. Aya's English-First Bias (English-First Ratio)
- Aya shows **low overall English-centric bias** (English-First Ratio = **15%**).
- Certain languages like **English** and **Santhali** still exhibit strong English-first processing.

> **Main Answer**: Aya does **not consistently "think" in English first**, *despite a small fraction of languages showing strong English-first processing*.

---

### 2. Aya's Token Likelihoods (Cosine Similarity)
- **Average cosine similarity** is **0.244**, showing moderate English similarity.
- **Only English** itself exhibits near-perfect similarity (cosine = **0.803**).

> **Main Answer**: Aya **does not** consistently process languages with English-like token distributions.

---

### 3. Aya’s QA Performance (Translation Impact)
- **Performance strongest in English**.
- Aya's multilingual capabilities might still require more **adaptation** and **refinement** for non-English languages.

> **Main Answer**: **Yes, translation improves Aya's QA performance** in the sense that **Aya performs better on English inputs**.

---

### 4. Aya’s Sentiment Steering Effectiveness
- **Stronger sentiment shifts in English**.
- Languages like **Telugu**, **Swahili** show poor steerability.

> **Main Answer**: Aya is **much more steerable in English**.

---

### 5. Aya's Factual Consistency Across Languages

Aya's factual knowledge **is not fully neutral** across languages. **Factual consistency** varies significantly, with an overall consistency rate of just **34.5%**. Additionally, **semantic similarity** between answers is **moderate**, with an average embedding similarity of **0.674**, but still shows **notable variation** across languages.

> **Main Answer**: Aya **does not** store factual knowledge in a fully language-neutral way.

Here’s the summary in well-structured English:

## Final Summary Conclusion

Aya exhibits **mixed English-first tendencies**, but overall, it does **not consistently rely on English** across all languages. While **English and some related languages** show stronger English-first processing, Aya demonstrates **adequate multilingual capabilities** for other languages.

* **English-first bias**: Aya shows a **low overall English-centric bias** (English-First Ratio = **15%**), with certain languages like **English** and **Santhali** displaying stronger English-first processing.
* **Token likelihoods**: The **average cosine similarity** is **0.244**, indicating moderate similarity to English. **Only English** itself exhibits near-perfect similarity (**0.803**).
* **QA performance**: Aya performs **best in English**, and while it shows promising multilingual capabilities, it still requires more **adaptation and refinement** for non-English languages.
* **Sentiment steering**: Aya is much **more steerable in English**, with stronger sentiment shifts. Languages like **Telugu** and **Swahili** show weaker steerability.
* **Factual consistency**: Aya's **factual knowledge is not fully neutral** across languages. **Factual consistency** varies, with an overall consistency rate of **34.5%**. Additionally, **semantic similarity** between answers is moderate (average similarity of **0.674**), though there is **notable variation** across languages.

> **Final Verdict**: Aya **does not consistently think in English first**, though certain languages show English-centric behavior. While it handles many languages reasonably well, Aya’s **internal knowledge and behavior are not fully language-neutral**, with **notable performance and consistency differences across languages**.
